I wanted to learn Reinforcement Learning so I thought this would be a good first exercise. Plus, the algorithm used in this project is used in _MuZero_ and _AlphaGo_ so really wanted to learn about it! 

## The Game
Connect Four is a two-player strategy game in which players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid, aiming to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs of the same color.

## Monte Carlo Tree Search
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a decision-making algorithm that builds a search tree by simulating random playouts from a given state, progressively refining its choices based on the results. It combines exploration of new moves with exploitation of known successful moves to find optimal actions. In particular, the _Upper Bound Confidence_ to set weights between these two.
